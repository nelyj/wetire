## Wetire (Weekly TI Report or WE TIRE)

Open Source automation platform to weekly TI Reports (github tasks, SQL Queries, Slack messages with 'bugs found' and server uptime, etc)

### Motivation:

I'm a freelance, consultant and team leader for some teams. In the last time, once a week, I need to write a reports for managers (CIO, CEO, etc). With specific queries, done task, server uptime and team achievements in some cases. Normally this persons for any reason prefer to use "Spreadsheets" to read this data. For this reason I'm going to automate this task.
